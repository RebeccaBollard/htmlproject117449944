    	     <div class="section" id="section1">Cloud Computing is the use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network (typically the Internet). With cloud computing, users can access files and use applications from any device that can access the Internet.</br> An example of a Cloud Computing provider is Google's Gmail. </div>
        	  <div class="section" id="section2">Why I love Cloud Services </br> <strong>It's Cheaper!</strong></br>Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenter.</br></br><strong>Flexibility</strong></br> is one of cloud computing's main benefits. As the user I can customize applications and access cloud services from anywhere with an internet connection.
        	  </br></br><strong>Reliability</strong></br>Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive, because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network. I never have to worry about running out of storage. I am no longer worried about accidentally deleting photos and being unable to recover them. For me this is a huge advantage of cloud computing.</div>
      	    <div class="section" id="section3">
      	        <strong>Cloud Service Examples:</strong></br> Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, Gmail, Cloud9.</br><strong>One of my most used Cloud services is:</strong> Cloud9.</br>
      	        Cloud9 IDE is an online integrated development environment, published as open source from version 3.0. It supports hundreds of programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript with Node.js, and Go.
      	        It enables developers to get started with coding immediately with pre-configured workspaces, collaborate with their peers with collaborative coding features, and web development features like live preview and browser compatibility testing.
      	       Since beginning my studies in Business Information Systems here at UCC, I have found Cloud9 particularly useful.Cloud 9 is an online based IDE. Unlike many other IDES,  The student benefits of Cloud 9 is that it’s an online development platform, so all your work is saved in the cloud.  So no more having to worry about saving files to a USB or other forms of storage.
      	       You can access your work from any computer, anywhere in the world.
